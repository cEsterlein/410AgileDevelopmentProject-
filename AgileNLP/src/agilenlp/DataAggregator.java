/*
PURPOSE:    DataAggregator is going to load all the data and then merge the data together into a single
            Entity that can be used for searching.
            Thinking about the idea of hashing at this juncture as well, but need to give that some thought.

            The idea behind it is movie will be merged with plot summary, and perhaps a list of character names for the movie, genres, etc.  
            So one object will contain ALL data merged together.
            
            The dataagregator will be responsible for this.
            Some entity MovieMaster (or something like that) will be the object that contains all this data together.
